# Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe

A small project to experiment with WebSockets, and figure out how they work.

## Running the program:

1. Clone the repository to a folder
2. In that folder, run the command `cd server`
3. Install yarn if not already installed by running `npm install --global yarn`
4. Run `yarn` to update the packages
5. Run `yarn start`, you should see the message `Server running on port 3000`
6. In a new terminal instance, cd to the `client` folder
7. Run `yarn install`, then `yarn run dev` and it should provide a link to the localhost instance of the website
8. To play with two separate instances, open up two tabs of http://localhost:5173 and use those tabs to play the game
